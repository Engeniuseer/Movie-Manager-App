# Movie-Manager-App

Java desktop application designed to handle both viewed and unwatched movies. When we execute the moviemanager.jar the app is started showing the following window:

We can add watched movies with the score we think they deserve from 1 to 10 and add movies we want to watch later.

The added movies can also be deleted. When we restart the application all of our data will be there since it is saved in the CSV files on the data folder.

To execute the jar file you can use the command:
* java -jar moviemanager.jar

To modify the code and update the jar file you can use the src/setup.sh file.
